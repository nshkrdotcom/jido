# ðŸ’€ REALITY.md - Heaven Was A Lie ðŸ’€

**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: PATH A FAILED SPECTACULARLY  
**Lesson**: Tests > Dialyzer  

## ðŸ˜­ What Happened

We tried **PATH A (HEAVEN)** to fix the Dialyzer errors "properly" by removing "unreachable" patterns.

**RESULT**: Broke 3 tests immediately because the patterns **WERE REACHABLE** in test scenarios.

## ðŸ’€ The Failures

1. **`route_signal(state, :invalid)`** - Test expects this to work
2. **`execute_signal(state, nil)`** - Test expects this to work  
3. **Nil router handling** - Test explicitly sets router to nil

## ðŸŽ¯ The Truth

**The tests were validating the defensive patterns that Dialyzer claimed were impossible.**

**Tests > Dialyzer** when it comes to runtime reality.

## ðŸ”„ SWITCHING TO PATH B

Clean rollback to stability as planned in HEAVEN.md.

**Real men don't ship broken tests.** ðŸ’ª
