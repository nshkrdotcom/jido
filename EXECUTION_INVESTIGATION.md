# üö® EXECUTION_INVESTIGATION.md - Critical Issue Analysis üö®

**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: INVESTIGATION REQUIRED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

## üî• The Problem

**Errors 10-11** from PURGATORY_2.md reveal a potential critical issue: `Jido.Exec.run/1` appears to be always failing in certain scenarios, making success patterns "unreachable" according to Dialyzer.

## üìç Location

**File**: `lib/jido/runner/simple.ex:142` and `lib/jido/runner/simple.ex:150`

## üîç What Dialyzer Sees

```elixir
case Jido.Exec.run(instruction) do
  {:ok, result} when is_map(result) ->
    # ... handles success
  {:ok, result, directives} when is_list(directives) ->  # <-- "UNREACHABLE"
    # ... handles success with directives  
  {:ok, result, directive} ->  # <-- "UNREACHABLE"  
    # ... handles success with single directive
  {:error, reason} ->
    # ... handles error - ONLY PATTERN THAT MATCHES
end
```

## ü§î Possible Root Causes

### 1. **Instruction Malformation**
- The instruction passed to `Jido.Exec.run/1` may be missing required fields
- Context injection may be breaking instruction structure
- Opts merging may be creating invalid configuration

### 2. **Action Module Issues**
- Action specified in instruction doesn't exist
- Action module doesn't implement required behavior
- Action module has compilation errors

### 3. **Context Problems**
- Line 131-133 shows context manipulation:
  ```elixir
  instruction = %{
    instruction
    | context: Map.put(instruction.context, :state, agent.state),
      opts: merged_opts
  }
  ```
- Agent state injection may be causing type mismatches
- Context may be getting corrupted

### 4. **Options Merging Issues**
- `merged_opts` may contain invalid or conflicting options
- Opts structure may not match what `Jido.Exec.run/1` expects

## üéØ Investigation Plan

### **Phase 1: Data Collection (30 minutes)**
1. Add debug logging before `Jido.Exec.run/1` call
2. Log the complete instruction structure
3. Log the action module and verify it exists
4. Log the context and opts being passed

### **Phase 2: Execution Analysis (45 minutes)**
1. Create minimal reproduction case
2. Test `Jido.Exec.run/1` with known-good instructions
3. Identify exactly what's failing in the execution pipeline
4. Check if it's a consistent failure or context-dependent

### **Phase 3: Fix Implementation (60 minutes)**
1. Based on findings, implement appropriate fix
2. Could be instruction validation, context handling, or error recovery
3. Ensure success patterns become reachable again

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

**This issue is deferred** because:

1. **Runtime works**: Tests pass, agents execute instructions successfully
2. **Type vs Reality**: Dialyzer analysis may not reflect actual runtime behavior  
3. **Priority**: Getting Foundation framework unblocked is more important
4. **Risk**: Deep investigation could introduce new problems

## üõ°Ô∏è Temporary Solution

The patterns are marked as "unreachable" but tests pass, suggesting:
- The failure may be in specific edge cases
- The defensive error pattern is handling the failures correctly
- Runtime behavior is working as expected despite type analysis

## üìã Recommendation

**DEFER INVESTIGATION** until Foundation framework is shipped. This is likely a type analysis issue rather than a runtime correctness issue.

If investigation becomes necessary:
1. Start with Phase 1 (data collection)
2. Create isolated test cases
3. Don't modify working code until issue is fully understood

## üéØ Exit Criteria

Consider this resolved when:
- Either Dialyzer sees success patterns as reachable
- Or we have documented proof that the "failure" is expected behavior
- Foundation framework ships successfully without execution issues
